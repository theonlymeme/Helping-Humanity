    <div class="body">
        <p>To use the HomeMapper, all you have to do is press a button for any of the following items that are currently available: “Make Room”, and “Make Furniture”. Once you have selected that particular item, you can draw the object on the canvas in the desired location that you wanted to. Once you have found the right size of your furnitures and/or room, click on the canvas again to finish drawing and placing that object in place. If you want to remove an object, click on the delete button and simply right click on that last selected object. That object will completely vanish afterwards.<br><br></p>
