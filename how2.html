    <div class="body">
        <p>To use the HomeMapper, all you have to do is press a button for any of the following items that are currently available: “Make Room”, and “Make Furniture”. Once you have selected that particular item, you will want to draw the object on the canvas in the desired location that you wanted to. BUT! Make sure that you carefully rearrange it and resize it as it should, otherwise you will potentially mess things up. Once you have found the correct size of your room, click on the canvas again to finish drawing that object in place. But, please be sure that you will only get one try at it, because once you finish placing that object, it will not be movable anymore. If you want to remove an object, click on the delete button and simply right click on that last selected object. That object will completely vanish afterwards.<br><br>To refresh the page, simply click on the Reset button. That will reload the page. Nuff said.</p>
