    <p id="Information"> The HomeMapper is made for the mentally impared and challenged, mainly Alzheimers. The increasing rate of people who develop Alzheimer's increases, so does the chance of people wandering. People can develop something called wandering, which means they don't know where they are and must wander to understand where they are. The HomeMapper stops wandering by allowing you to map the entire house with simple shapes in a simple browser window. </p>  </p>
