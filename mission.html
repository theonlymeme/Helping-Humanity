            <p>Our mission is to make it absolutely free to help with higher stage Dementia also known as Alzheimers. We plan on working with some Elderly homes to bring this idea to life for nothing but hard work and dedication. We also strive to help the mentally challenged by creating programs and giving them out to the world for free use. We also strive to make our programs as reliable as possible so that the caregivers won’t have to burden. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="body2">
            <p>HomeMapper will be used in many Elderly homes. They Will be able to post them on the walls and in rooms, but HomeMapper isn’t just for elderly homes. You can pin up maps around your house so that if the elder doesn’t want to go into an elderly home, then bring part of the elderly home to you. If you combine the HomeMapper with a small GPS or tracker you know that if they are able to leave they won’t go too far. </p>
